# GC-Net
A CNN classifier which can efficiently classify between a glaucomatous and normal eye. 
It gives better results than the existing architecture as it extracts features from the retinal image by splitting the image into 3 channels i.e red, blue and green. It extracts features the channels simultaneously and then combines the result into one.
